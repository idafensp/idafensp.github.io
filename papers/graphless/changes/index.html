                <li><p> We have stressed that the assumptions we state are introduced by us, and that are the motivation of the paper itself. As we are not validating them, we did not introduce them as hypothesis. </p></li>

                <li><p>We have added the followging sentence to indicate how our system handles resources with no type: &quot;Only resources with types are thus considered in the system.&quot; </p></li>
                <li><p> The definiton of ingoing and outgoing properties has been modified to make it more clear. </p></li>
