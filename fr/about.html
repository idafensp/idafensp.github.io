                <p>Scientific reviews are a relevant aspect of the research publication workflow. Traditionally, they are often hidden behind a publisher wall, being only accessible to editors, reviewers, and, afterwards, to authors. However, they constitute a highly valuable asset of the scientific process. Any scientific review contains the description of a thoughtful analysis conducted by an expert on the topic the reviewed paper addressed. Thus, they provide interesting insights about the paper and have enrich its understanding for the potential reader.</p>

                <p>FAIR* reviews aim to leverage the full potential of scientific reviews by exposing them publicly to the scientific community. Our goal is to provide reviewers with the proper means to expose their work on the web, making them available and consumable by different means. </p>

                <p>Rather than being just a centralized review provider, FAIR* reviews supports not only a platform for review publishing, but also a model for generating and documenting them, allowing their self publication as well. FAIR* reviews are semantically rich and web-native digital objects, which are based on the Linked Open Data initiative and are aligned with the FAIR data principles. This way reviews:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Findable:</strong> will be represented by an IRI, making them identifiable on the web.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> will provide public metadata about them and how they were conducted.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Interoperable:</strong> will use standard vocabularies for digital documents.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Reusable:</strong> will define a public license allowing for its proper usage.</li>
                
                </ul>

                <p>Whereas many publishing bodies are not willing to embrace this sort of ideas, several contributions have appeared in last years promoting a more open environment for reviews, including journals, conferences and standalone platforms. Using the resources provided by FAIR* reviews, reviewers and editors will be able to publish their work as Linked Data, either by themselves or within the FAIR* reviews platform.</p>
